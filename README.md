# my first gherkin

## Author: Juan Santos Poyato

## About this project

This is my first gherkin project. You must have installed node.js and cucumber:

> npm install cucumber

In order to be able to run cucumber with:

>npx cucumber-js

Once your working directory is in this folder.

Gherkin scripts and JS implementation are both inside features folder (and steps_definitions, respectively).
